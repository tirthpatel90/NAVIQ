      "focus": "Runtime Internals",
      "difficulty": "Advanced",
      "answer": "The GIL allows only one bytecode instruction to execute at a time, so CPU-bound threads end up time-slicing and rarely scale. For parallel CPU work we move to multiprocessing, native extensions, or distribute work through Celery or Ray.",
